          <p>
            I am an Emmy-winning full-stack software engineer currently working
            at a video game studio, with expertise in React, Node, Unity, and
            .NET. My proficiency in C++ and Python also adds to my diverse skill
            set.
          </p>
          <p>
            I enjoy building development tools, frameworks, reusable components,
            and base classes and writing documentation to improve productivity
            and development time.
          </p>
          <p>
            My focus is on creating accessible and enjoyable user experiences
            through thoughtful design and creative expression, particularly at
            the intersection of web development, human-computer interaction, and
            multimedia.
          </p>
          <p>
            I believe in the importance of both front-end and back-end
            development to create a truly exceptional user experience. I am
            passionate about finding innovative ways to blur the line between
            art and tool, with a particular fascination for pushing the
            boundaries of software applications and human-computer interaction
            and I have experience working with industry leaders such as
            Nintendo, Princess Cruises, and Sony Television Pictures to develop
            software solutions that push these boundaries.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have a talent for designing visually appealing websites and
            interactive graphics and I enjoy tackling complex challenges, from
            fine-tuning machine learning models to writing shaders and
            generative art.
          </p>
          <p>
            As a strong team member, I am reliable, enjoy collaboration, am
            always open to learning new things, and have an affinity for
            teaching others. I'm excited to continue creating and innovating in
            the field of software engineering.

          <p>I'm a Los Angeles native who now calls San Francisco home.</p>
          <p>
            I have always had a love for technology, which led me to pursue a
            degree in Computer Science with a minor in Math.
          </p>
          <p>
            Outside of work, I enjoy spending time with my two dogs, taking long
            walks, running, hiking, traveling, playing video games, collecting
            vinyl records, and attending music festivals.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm also an avid reader, history buff, and Game of Thrones fanatic.
